# Ritas-Flavour-magic
 I have developed an Admin Dashboard for Ritaâ€™s Flavour Magic, an initiative by kudumbasree unit.
Here, everyone can access the website. Two logins are provided. 
1) Admin [ email : admin , password:12345 ]
2) User
When logged in with Admin credentials, along with the other menus, the ADMIN menu will be displayed on the navigation bar, where admin can perform CRUD operation by adding, editing, updating and deleting the product. Once it is done he can logout.
If user wants to buy some products in PRODUCTS menu, he has to click on buy now option. When clicked, he will redirect to login page. If he is not a registered user, he has to register to be logged in. Once logged in he will redirect to homepage for now. Further enhancement is to develop a payment gateway for the user to buy products.
